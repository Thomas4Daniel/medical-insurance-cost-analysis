This orbital is significant because it plays a key role in chemical reactions, particularly in processes like **electron donation** (e.g., in redox reactions) and **bond formation**.\n",

        "- The **bright regions** (often colored red or blue in the plot) represent areas of high electron density.\n",
        "- The **dim regions** (often white or transparent) represent areas of low or no electron density.\n",
